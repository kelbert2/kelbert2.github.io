                <p>
                    A lot of university students need help but don't get it. Sometimes it's because they don't know how much they could improve, or what steps they'd have to take to receive services, or, sometimes, the university just isn't equipped to treat them. We need to fix this. We can. Through a partnership with Duke Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPS), this site will allow students to understand the services covered by their student health care and where to go to fill in the gaps. Also offers a scientifically validated short screening test to gauge whether a student should seek help, and then show them just how easy it is.

Through the use of ARKit and Unity, a guitar can be displayed on the screen, and so will the note and chord names as the user plays them.
