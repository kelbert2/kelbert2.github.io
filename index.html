                An iPad app for a visual novel exploring the printmaking revolution in Venice. An adaption of a

            <li><span class="subtitle">Duke Mental Health Screening</span>
                A lot of university students need help but don't get it. Sometimes it's because they don't know
                how much they could improve, or what steps they'd have to take to receive services, or,
                sometimes, the university just isn't equipped to treat them. We need to fix this. We can.
                Through a partnership with Duke Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPS), this site will
                allow students to understand the services covered by their student healthcare and where to go to
                fill in the gaps. Also offers a scientifically validated short screening test to gauge whether a
                student should seek help, and then show them just how easy it is.

            <li><span class="subtitle">AiR Guitar</span>
                <p>
                    An iOS app that plays notes as a person play air guitar. Using some cool CoreML libraries,
                    the app can recognize guitar fingerings on objects that aren't necessarily guitar necks.
                    Through the use of ARKit and Unity, a guitar can be displayed on the screen, and so will the
                    note and chord names as the user plays them.

                <p>
                    There's a lot of awesome webpages that let users test out gradient colors and styles, but it
                    is difficult to find one that displays multiple gradients overlayed. This site can fill that
